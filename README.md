# web-scraping

### Background:
#### The homework assigned had the purpose of testing our skills and understanding about web scraping and rendering using MongoDB and Flask.

### Web Scraping:
#### The code in the Jupyter notebook towards obtaining the data via web scraping is functional. I ran into some difficulties in using splinter vs selenium. Overall, both libraries were used in some way to obtain the information needed from the websites.

### MongoDB and Flask
#### The app file was created, as well as the index html file. Work towards the mongo db was completed and records were updated. Flask was not completed. The modification of the app.py file did not result in access to the objects in the MongoDB. This could have been due to incorrect dictionary built to upload collection to MongoDB.
