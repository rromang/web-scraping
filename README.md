# web-scraping-challenge

### Background:
#### The homework assigned had the purpose of testing our skills and understanding about web scraping and rendering using MongoDB and Flask.

### Web Scraping:
#### The code in the Jupyter notebook towards obtaining the data via web scraping is functional. I ran into some difficulties in using splinter vs selenium. Overall, both libraries were used in some way to obtain the information needed from the websites.

### MongoDB and Flask
#### The app file was created and work towards the mongo db and flask rendering were initiated. There is an error for the data insertion of the collection that has prevented the completion of the assignment. Troubleshooting is ongoing but will not be done by due date.
