# web-scraping-challenge

### Background:
#### The homework assigned had the purpose of testing our skills and understanding about web scraping and rendering using MongoDB and Flask.

### Web Scraping:
#### The code in the Jupyter notebook towards obtaining the data via web scraping is functional. I ran into some difficulties in using splinter vs selenium. Overall, both libraries were used in some way to obtain the information needed from the websites.

### MongoDB and Flask
#### Although the files were started, there was some difficulties getting the web scraping code to work as well as some time constraints that did not allowed for the completion of the code.
